                                    As a child, and throughout my teen years I was plagued with health problems ranging
                                    from the niggling to the major. I suffered from poor self-image and poor
                                    self-confidence. One of my earliest and most traumatic memories is of shivering with
                                    fear when waiting for my turn to read out a passage from the English text book in
                                    school.
                                </p>
                                <p class="about-para">
                                    These minor health problems started escalating and finally the time when I developed
                                    Rheumatism was the accelerated decline of my health - mentally and physically. The
                                    wheelchair became my companion, and my eye sight was nearly gone. No amount of
                                    treatment or diet restrictions helped. Though I had learnt to live with RA,
                                    accepting it as inevitable and resigning myself to my fate, losing my eyesight was
                                    literally the worst moment of my life…& I felt like a victim!..helpless & worthless
                                </p>
                                <p class="about-para">
                                    But from the depths of my despair, feeling completely hopeless crumbling with no
                                    sense of internal power came the turning point of my life…..to understand
                                    relationship between the experiences of our past and chronic illnesses.
                                </p>

                                    From there on there was no looking back as I started studying more and more about
                                    the human body, food, supplements, exercises, yoga, soul-mind-body connection &
                                    eventually got to know about pioneer Marisa Peer and that was the beginning of a
                                    transformation beyond imagination. A transformation that catapulted me towards
                                    achieving my ultimate purpose in life - helping people and guiding them.
