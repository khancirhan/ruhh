                        <h2 class="faq-question">Q1 - What is Rapid Transformation Therapy?</h2>
                        <p class="faq-answer">
                            RTT® is a standalone therapy developed by Marisa Peer over 30 years. RTT® works by
                            establishing the root cause of the problem, which is often not what our conscious minds
                            would have us believe. We work with our clients to establish the root cause of their
                            problems. In effect, RTT® identifies and corrects what really stops you from changing.
                        </p>

                    <div class="faq-content">
                        <h2 class="faq-question">Q2 - Is working online as effective as working in person?</h2>
                        <p class="faq-answer">
                            Absolutely!
                            <br />

                            RTT® is just as effective online as in person. Since RTT® is a closed eye process, like
                            hypnotherapy, the only real difference between a face-to-face session and an online session
                            is who provides the safe space - will it be the therapist providing use of their office or
                            will it be you in the comfort of your own home? Many clients report feeling even more
                            relaxed when having RTT® at home.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="faq-question">Q3 - How many sessions should I expect to have?</h2>
                        <p class="faq-answer">
                            Your therapist will always be working towards your first session being the last session you
                            will ever need.
                            <br />

                            As standard, we advise that RTT® delivers lasting results in 1–3 sessions, but your
                            therapist will discuss this with you in more detail on your initial consultation.
                        </p>

                        <p class="faq-answer">
                            RTT® sessions last 90 minutes – 2 hours. You must also commit to listening to the recording
                            created for you in the session for 21 days. This locks in the changes made and is a vital
                            part of the process.

                        <p class="faq-answer">
                            Traditional hypnosis addresses the presenting issue, for example, anxiety. RTT® however will
                            help you to discover what has led you to feel anxious so you can ultimately be free from the
                            limiting belief.

                        <p class="faq-answer">
                            Hypnosis is a natural state. Some people just take a little longer than others. Your
                            therapist is skilled in dealing with all types of clients and will be able to support you
                            fully through the process.
                            <br />

                            In fact, everyone spends a huge portion of their day in one form of trance or another
                            without realizing it. Have you ever driven somewhere only to get out of the car and not
                            really remember how you got there? Have you ever walked into a room and thought, what am I
                            here for again?
                            <br />

                            Well, they are trance states, and you have been accessing those all by yourself.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="faq-content">
                        <h2 class="faq-question">Q7 - I’ve tried everything else—will this work?</h2>
                        <p class="faq-answer">
                            We get this question a lot.
                            <br />

                            There are lots of fabulous therapies out there, and we would never take anything off the
                            table, but very few therapies are brave enough to look at the root cause specifically. By
                            doing so RTT® will often succeed where other therapies have not.
                            <br />

                            Some therapies will focus on the behavior exclusively. Others believe that verbalizing the
                            problem is enough to generate change. There are even some modalities that believe the root
                            cause of a person's problems is not important. Understanding is powerful in transforming
                            beliefs & behaviors. That true understanding only comes when we delve beyond our conscious
                            thoughts. If you really knew what the problem was you wouldn't be here, right?
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="faq-content">
                        <h2 class="faq-question">Q8 - What if it doesn’t work?</h2>
                        <p class="faq-answer">
                            There isn’t a single medication or therapy on the planet that works for 100% of people, 100%
                            of the time, but what we can say with confidence is RTT® works for most people, most of the
                            time.
                            <br />

                            The level of understanding given in an RTT® session, alongside the transformation and 21-day
                            recording, plus the support on offer via the FAST service, makes RTT® fully comprehensive
                            and empowering for our clients.
